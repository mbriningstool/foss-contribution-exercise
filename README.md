# foss-contribution-exercise

Simple example package to demo techniques of contributing to open-source

As an exercise, this repo is intentionally:

- simple
- silly 
- incomplete
- partially wrong!  (we have to have bugs to work against, after all)

# Techniques to demo 

# The package: word-calculator 

Lets you perform arithmetic with words.

    >>> from word-calculator import calc
    >>> calc('3 plus 4')
    7

# Installing 
  
Actually, don't install, just invoke `python3` from the same directory that 
contains `word-calculator.py`

    $ git clone https://github.com/dayton-dynamic/foss-contribution-exercise
    $ cd foss-contribution-exercise
    $ python3


# Features 

- Adds numbers with "plus" 
- Subtracts numbers with "minus"
